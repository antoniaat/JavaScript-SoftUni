# Project Assignment for the [CSS Advanced Course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2183/css-advanced-november_2018)

**Design** and **implement** a website about a topic of **YOUR CHOICE** using mainly **HTML & CSS**. The site should follow several requirements which are stated below. Any additional technologies and techniques that you use will be treated as **bonuses**. Do **NOT SACRIFICE REQUIRED** functionality for **UNREQUIRED** functionality. Implement first what is required and only then, think of additional things that can be added.

## **1. Requirements**
* **Use HTML & CSS** – the major part of your work should be HTML & CSS - **written by you**
	* You **must** use the **CSS preprocessor - SASS _(Gulp)_**
	* You **must** use the **CSS Grids**
	*	You **may** use JavaScript and JS libraries like Slick and Sweet Alert to simplify your work
	*	You **may** use PHP or other server-side scripting but not as primary technology (e.g. you may use PHP for including HTML fragments to avoid repeating code)
* **Work Alone**
	* Use **GitHub** as project collaboration platform
	* You should have more than **15 commits** in **5 different days**
* **Create original content** – your content should be written / created by you, not copy-pasted
	* You may take and adopt ideas from other sites, but avoid direct copy / paste of their content
* **Web design**
	* Using your own web design (creative art work) is **allowed** but **not required**
	* You may use free images, icons and other site elements from Internet
	* You may use portions of other site's design, but don't copy / paste them entirely
* **Publish your project live in Internet**
	* Your website should be **hosted** in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
	* You may share your project to get external feedback
* **Valid and high-quality HTML and CSS**   
	* Follow the **best practices** for high-quality HTML and CSS: good formatting, good code structure, consistent naming, semantic HTML, correct usage of classes, etc.
* **Responsive design** – your site should open correctly and be functional at any modern device
	* Standard **desktop** Web browser (computer / laptop)
	* **Tablets** (Android, iPad, Windows, Linux)
	* **Smartphones** (Android, iPhone, Windows Phone)
	* Typical screen widths to support: 1600px, 1024px, 960px, 768px, 640px, 480px, 320px.
* **Usability and UX**
	* Your site should be easy-to-use, with intuitive UI, with good usability
	* You may follow some usability guide / checklist [(search in Google)](https://www.google.com/search?q=web+site+usability+checklist)
* **Target all major modern browsers**
	* Use **HTML5 and CSS3**, not HTML 4.01 or CSS 2.1
	* Ensure your site works correctly in the latest **HTML5-compatible browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari (latest versions, desktop and mobile versions)
	* You do **NOT** need to support old browsers like IE9

## **2. Forbidden Techniques and Tools**
* Using HTML and CSS **site templates** from Internet is **forbidden**
* Using **CMS systems** (like WordPress, Drupal and Joomla) is **forbidden**
* Using **site authoring tools** and **site generators** (like Adobe Edge, Microsoft Expression Design, Adobe Dreamweaver, etc.) is **forbidden**
* The use of **client-side** and **server-side** **frameworks** is forbidden
	* Your content should be in HTML files, not in a database or in the cloud

## **3. Work Alone**
* Your HTML and CSS should be written by yourself, not copied from somewhere
	* Use **GitHub** as your source-code repository and project management tool
	* Your **source code** should be published as **open-source project** in Internet

## **4. Deliverables**
* **Source Code** - Submit the **URL** of your project **source code in GitHub** as deliverable
	* Put the following assets in the project repository:
		* The complete **source code** of your project (HTML, CSS, images, scripts and other files)
		* Any other project assets (optionally): documentation, design, tests, etc
* **Published Live Project in Internet**
	* Put a link to your **live project** in the project description at GitHub
* **Commit Logs**
	* Each team member should have **at least 15 commits** (changes) in the project repository
	* Please **commit every day** during the project development to demonstrate your work progress
	* More commits (especially in more than the last 1-2 days) are better during the project assessment

## **5. Project Defense**
Each project should be presented in front of a commission of trainers.
Each person will have only **~10 minutes** for the following:
*	Demonstrate the website **content and functionality** (very shortly)
*	Demonstrate the site in different screen sizes **(responsive design)**
*	Show the **source code** and explain briefly how it works

**Hints** for better presentation:
*	Be **well prepared** for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time
*	**Open all project assets** beforehand to save time: open your site in the browser, open your project repository page to show the commit logs, etc.
*	Please be **strict in timing!** You might get less score if your time is not spent the right way
